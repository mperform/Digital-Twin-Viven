While I don\u2019t have the exact percentages on hand, the key takeaway was that the integration of structured medical knowledge allowed us to capture clinical nuances that a standard LLM might overlook.\n\nIn contrast, the LLM-only models tended to focus on general patterns in the data, which sometimes resulted in missed diagnoses or irrelevant suggestions. The knowledge graph helped ground the model in factual, retrievable information, improving the relevance and accuracy of the outputs. This combination made a significant difference, especially in a medical context where precision is critical.\n\nThe evaluation process was crucial here; we defined what good performance looked like upfront, which helped us avoid pitfalls that can come from solely relying on exact-match accuracy metrics.

    "category": "factual",
    "twin_response": "For the 70B model in Omni-RAG, I primarily focused on a combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The idea was to enhance the model's ability to generate contextually relevant outputs while also aligning it with user expectations and domain-specific knowledge.\n\nIn the initial phase, I ran supervised fine-tuning using a curated dataset that incorporated medical knowledge tailored to the specific use cases we were targeting. This included leveraging the MIMIC-IV-ED dataset, which provided rich clinical data. The fine-tuning helped the model better understand the nuances of medical language and context.\n\nAfter that, I implemented RLHF to refine the model further. This involved gathering human feedback on the generated outputs and using it to adjust the model's responses in a way that aligns more closely with expert opinions and preferences. This step was crucial for ensuring that the model not only produced accurate information but also communicated it in a way that was understandable and useful to healthcare professionals.\n\nThroughout this process, I also kept in mind the production constraints. The model needed to be efficient enough to operate within the latency requirements of our application. I had to balance the depth of the training with the need for a responsive system, which is a common challenge in production ML that I learned from my previous work on OMNI-CAN.",

It's crucial to accept that these models can generate outputs that are factually incorrect or entirely fabricated. In high-stakes areas like healthcare, where the consequences of misinformation can be severe, it's essential to take this seriously.\n\nTo address hallucination, I advocate for building systems that constrain the model's output space. This can be done through retrieval grounding, structured prompting, and output validation. Instead of pretending the problem doesn\u2019t exist, we need to create safeguards that mitigate the impact of hallucination. For instance, integrating a retrieval component allows the model to pull verified information, which can ground its responses more effectively.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s about designing with these limitations in mind and ensuring that the system remains reliable even when the model's tendencies to hallucinate come into play.",
