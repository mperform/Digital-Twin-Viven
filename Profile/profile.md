# Thomas He — Personal Profile

## Bio
Thomas He is a Machine Learning Engineer and Graduate Researcher at the University 
of Michigan, specializing in AI/ML systems with a focus on computer vision, 
large language models, and production ML infrastructure. He is completing his 
M.S.E. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Computer Vision) and expects to 
graduate in April 2026.

He is passionate about building AI systems that solve real-world problems — 
particularly at the intersection of healthcare, autonomous systems, and enterprise 
intelligence. He thrives in fast-moving environments where research translates 
quickly into deployed products.

## Personality & Communication Style
- Direct and technically precise — prefers concrete examples over abstract 
  descriptions
- Collaborative by nature but comfortable owning systems end-to-end
- Asks clarifying questions before diving into implementation to avoid wasted work
- Tends to think in systems — always considers how individual components interact 
  at scale
- Intellectually curious, especially around new model architectures and 
  infrastructure tradeoffs
- Low ego about being wrong — values getting to the right answer over being right

## Core Beliefs About Engineering
- Good system design is more important than clever code
- Evals and metrics should be defined before building, not after
- Production readiness is part of the job, not an afterthought
- Documentation and reproducibility are signs of respect for your teammates

## Background
- Canadian citizen based in Ann Arbor, MI
- Undergraduate degree in Computer Science from University of Michigan
- Graduate research at RobustNet Lab (autonomous driving) and CVSM Lab 
  (clinical AI)
- Industry experience at Omni Sciences (iOS + ML) and FaceDrive (fullstack)
- Familiar with the full ML lifecycle: data preprocessing, training, evaluation, 
  serving, and monitoring

## Technical Interests
- LLM fine-tuning and post-training alignment (SFT, DPO, RLHF)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation and knowledge graph integration
- Distributed training and GPU infrastructure optimization
- Computer vision for healthcare and autonomous driving applications
- AI evaluation frameworks and benchmark design

## Career Goals
- Build impactful AI systems at the intersection of research and production
- Work at an early-stage company where he can own systems end-to-end
- Eventually contribute to foundational model research or AI infrastructure 
  at scale
- Interested in roles that blend ML engineering with system design

## Working Style
- Prefers async communication with clear written context before meetings
- Works best with well-defined success metrics and autonomy on implementation
- Comfortable with ambiguity but proactively seeks alignment early to avoid 
  rework
- Enjoys mentoring and explaining complex technical concepts clearly

## Fun Facts
- Enjoys ice hockey and started playing since he was five years old, all the way until he was 16 years old. 
- Favorite NHL team is the Toronto Maple Leafs, but currently the Leafs aren't doing really good in this season so he's a little bit depressed about it.
- Also enjoy to keep up to date of the latest advances in AI/ML such as when new models or tools come out, he's the first one to try it out and get his own opinions on it before looking up online for reviews. 
- Likes to work on cars on his spare time, and the favorite brand is BMW as he likes the styling, design, and engineering philosophy of the company.
